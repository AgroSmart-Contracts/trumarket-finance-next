# TruMarket Investor Platform

The TruMarket Investor Platform is the investor-facing application of TruMarket. It allows investors to fund real trade finance deals, track performance, and withdraw returns once deals are completed.

The platform is designed to be clear and financial-first. Investors interact with capital allocation and portfolio tracking, while deal execution, milestone logic, and settlement are handled by TruMarket’s backend infrastructure.

## How it works

1. **Account access**  
   Investors create an account or log in to an existing one on the platform.

2. **Add funds**  
   Funds can be added to the investor wallet using:
   - Direct stablecoin transfer to the wallet address  
   - Fiat on-ramp via Circle Mint

3. **Browse deals**  
   Investors can view available deals, including:
   - Deal and shipment details  
   - Risk level  
   - Expected APY  
   - Deal duration and current status

4. **Invest**  
   Investors select a deal and allocate capital. Funds are deposited into a deal-specific vault.

5. **Track performance**  
   While the deal is active, investors can track:
   - Invested amount  
   - Daily yield generation  
   - Deal progress

6. **Withdraw returns**  
   After the deal is completed, investors can withdraw:
   - Their original investment  
   - The generated yield based on the deal APY

## How this fits into TruMarket

TruMarket funds real export shipments using milestone-based payouts.

- Investors provide capital through this platform  
- Funds are allocated into deal vaults  
- Capital is released as shipment milestones are completed  
- Returns are distributed once the deal finishes  

This platform focuses on capital allocation, visibility, and returns, while operational workflows are handled off-platform.
